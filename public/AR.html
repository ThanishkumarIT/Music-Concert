            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. R. Rahman is an Indian composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, musician, multi-instrumentalist 
                and philanthropist. Described as the world's most prominent and prolific film composer by Time, his 
                works are notable for integrating Eastern classical music with electronic music sounds, world music 
                genres and traditional orchestral arrangements. He has won two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a
                 BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe, four National Film Awards, fifteen Filmfare Awards and thirteen Filmfare 
                 Awards South in addition to numerous other awards and nominations. His extensive body of work for film 
                 and the stage earned him the nickname "the Mozart of Madras" and several Tamil commentators and fans 
                 have coined him the nickname Isai Puyal (English: Music Storm). In 2009, Time placed Rahman in its list 
                 of World's Most Influential People. The UK based World Music magazine Songlines named him one of
                  'Tomorrow's World Music Icons' in August 2011. Having set up his own in-house studio called Panchathan 
                  Record Inn at Chennai, arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and high-tech studios, Rahman's film 
                  scoring career began in the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja. ?Working in India's various film 
                  industries, international cinema and theatre, Rahman is one of the world's all-time top-selling
                   recording artists. In a notable career spanning two decades, Rahman has garnered particular acclaim 
                   for redefining contemporary Indian film music and thus contributing to the success of several films. 
                   Rahman is currently one of the highest-paid composers of the motion picture industry. He is a notable
                    humanitarian and philanthropist, donating and raising money for beneficial causes and supporting 
                    charities.</p>
